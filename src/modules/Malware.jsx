                            A virus is a computer program with malicious logic and replicate itself repeatedly over the network. Though Computer virus is working like a biological virus, i.e. enter into the computer without notice to the user of the system and spread to other computers, maintains its dormancy and keeps its polymorphic nature. The name is coined from Vital Information Resource Under Siege (VIRUS).

                            Computer viruses are executable computer programs designed to replicate and damage the computer system without users’ knowledge and permission. Computer virus gets activated on certain triggered conditions known as “Catalyst”. A computer virus program is logical activity and have its own mechanism to avoid detection by the user and activate on a particular time or occasion. Such viruses are called “stealth viruses”. The trigger could be a particular date for example Thursday 12th (Alias CD), Friday the 13th for Jerusalem Virus. Some time a code is also embedded in some legislate programme, i.e. set to explore when certain conditions made and such viruses are called logical viruses.

                        <p>
                            A virus can affect operating system, computer files, data files, executable programs, bootable disk, hard disk partitions, boot sector etc. Generally, when it gets activated it can hide in RAM (Random Access Memory), Upper memory, High memory, TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident), MBR (Master Boot Record) extended and expanded memory. Viruses are categorized into boot sector infectors and program file infectors (for example .exe, .doc, .sys, .dill, .ovl, .scr,.xa, .xls).

                            Trojan Horse is a type of non-self-replicating type of malware programmes containing malicious code which carries out predetermined actions based on the nature of Trojan. On execution it cost, loss or theft of data for slowing down the performance of the system.

                            Trojan act as back-door entry programme gets dropped in a system without notice of the user. A trojan may also give remote access to a hacker for the targeted computer systems. Harmful trojan horse can damage system in many ways such as crashing the computer, data corruption, formatting disk, keystroke logging, deletion of files, data theft, perform automated spamming or denial-of-service attack, viewing user’s webcam, modification of registry, downloading and installing third party malware etc.

                            Now a days, virus can also get attacked to data files such as .doc, .xls, .pps, .mdb, etc. Such viruses called “Macros”. Some of these viruses are polymorphic in nature which mutates and changes its identifiable codes with each infection. Macro viruses are generally independent ‘malware’ programme which do not require any host. It replicates itself and spreads. In contrast to virus, some malicious programme do to replicate such programmes are called “Trojan Horses”.

                            Spyware programme helps in gathering information about a person and organisation without knowledge. Spyware is classified into four types: System monitors, Trojans, Adware and tracking cookies.
